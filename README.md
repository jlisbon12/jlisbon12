# About Me

I'm currently enrolled in the undergrad course of Computer Science at Kennesaw State University. I like to say I'm a tech ~~connoisseur~~ enthusient 
that enjoy creating things at the top of my head (even though I would probably never finish it). I also enjoy hiking, drinking matcha latte, and
watching documentaries about different conflicts in society around the world. I want this profile to showcase the most important concepts 
in different programming languages by using real-world cases.

Thanks for viewing my gits!
